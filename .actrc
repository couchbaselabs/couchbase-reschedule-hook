# Act is a useful tool for testing github actions workflows locally
# https://github.com/nektos/act
# Use the act-workflow make command to run the actions. To keep the act image small,
# we use a custom one that includes the tools we need for the workflows.
# A pipeline that passes in act is not guaranteed to complete in gh actions, but it's a good
# indicator and a useful way to get fast-feedback of test results
